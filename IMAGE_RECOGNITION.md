# Image Recognition with gpt-4o-mini

## Image Recognition and Object Detection

As demonstrated by [the experiment](https://youtu.be/1yXJCsx69_0) I conducted, GPT-4o-mini excels at image recognition and can perform object detection to some extent. However, for accurately identifying the positions of objects, it is better to rely on AI specifically designed for object detection.

## Image Classification and Personal Information Protection

What I have observed:

- gpt-4o-mini does not respond to private questions such as gender, age, or facial expressions.
- It answers accurately to questions about what people are doing, which direction they are facing, or how many people are present.
- It also provides accurate descriptions of the environment where people are located.

Therefore, gpt-4o-mini is useful for image classification.

The classification of gender, age or fracial expressions needs to rely on other systems such as facial recognition systems or wireless tags.

In conclusion, from a marketing perspective, image classification using GPT-4o-mini enables the delivery of content tailored to people's gestures and the environments they are placed in.
