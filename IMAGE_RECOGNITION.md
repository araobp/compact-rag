# Image Recognition with gpt-4o-mini

## Personal Information Protection

What I have observed:

- gpt-4o-mini does not respond to private questions such as gender, age, or facial expressions.
- It answers accurately to questions about what people are doing, which direction they are facing, or how many people are present.
- It also provides accurate descriptions of the environment where people are located.
