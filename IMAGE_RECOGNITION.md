# Image Recognition and Object Detection with gpt-4o-mini

## Object Detection

As demonstrated by [the experiment](https://youtu.be/1yXJCsx69_0) I conducted, GPT-4o-mini excels at image recognition and can perform object detection to some extent. However, for accurately identifying the positions of objects, it is better to rely on AI specifically designed for object detection.

## Image Classification

What I have observed:

- gpt-4o-mini is not particularly good at determining a personâ€™s gender, age, or expression and tends to refuse to answer, but it can provide guesses depending on the prompt.
- It answers accurately to questions about what people are doing, which direction they are facing, or how many people are present.
- It also provides accurate descriptions of the environment where people are located.

Therefore, image recognition and classification by GPT-4o-mini can be applied to the generation of dynamic marketing content tailored to visitors.

## Image Classification with Infrared Array Sensor

If using a camera poses privacy concerns, let's try using an infrared array sensor.
